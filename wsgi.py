These imports:
    - Import the `create_app` factory function from your app package
    - Import `serve` from waitress, which is a production WSGI server for Python web applications
    - Import the `os` module to access environment variables

This calls the factory function to instantiate your Flask application with all configurations, blueprints, and extensions.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if os.environ.get('FLASK_ENV') == 'development':
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)

"""
This part determines how to run the application:

1.If the FLASK_ENV environment variable is set to 'development':
    It uses Flask's built-in development server with app.run()
    This server is good for development but not recommended for production


Otherwise (presumably in production):

It uses the Waitress WSGI server with serve()
Waitress is a production-ready WSGI server that's more robust than Flask's built-in server



In both cases:

host='0.0.0.0' means the server will be accessible from any IP address, not just localhost
port=5000 specifies the port number the server will listen on

The parenthesis at the end appears to be a typo - there's an extra closing parenthesis that should be removed.
This setup demonstrates a good practice of using different servers for development and production environments, with the environment configuration controlled through environment variables.
